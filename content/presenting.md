# Presenting at JSLA

## Length

* JS Made Simple talks: should not take any longer than 5 mins. Keep it simple, yeah?
* Regular presentations: Plan on **20-30 mins** with 10 mins for questions. 

Please try to keep it to close 20 mins if possible, people start tuning out around that time. Don't worry about moving too fast, we record the talks and most folks stick around for drinks after so even if you don't get tons of questions during your talk or the time set aside for questions you will get people asking about your talk content outside of the structured talk time.

The timing limits are about attention span and consistently creating an enjoyable event that people want to frequent. We have had some of our better talks run longer (like John Bender or substack) but attention starts waning even for the best of presenters around 20 mins. Also being timed constrained tends to keep the presentations more focused. Use your discretion and value the attendees other presenters attention and time. 

## Skill level

We intentionally try not to cater to beginners "too" much and instead focus on trying to create a consistent and highly technical group that most senior developers want to frequent. We encourage our presenters to do the same, there are some beginners but most frequent attendees are mid-level to senior developers. 

Keep in mind we record video and that audience will be familiar with your general topics and have the ability to pause/ rewind and look stuff up as you present.

## Equipment

### Projector hook ups

We have most adapters for common computers used in web development. If you are using something other than an Apple laptop with mini DVI or HDMI outs please let us know at least a few days before the event. If you have your own adapters please bring them, it'a always good to have backups. 

If you are using ubuntu or some other nix based os that requires making adjustments to hook to projectors please let us know ahead of time so we can get you the specs and you can check that you will be compatible when it's time to present.

## WIFI

Most venues have it but sometimes things don't work right, especially when you have 80 or so people with laptops and smart phones all using the same access points. When possible we try to set aside space on a network for presenters and do bring devices you can tether to. All that being said, things can and have go wrong. Sometimes it is best to have your presentation work on your local host only just in case. It's best to limit the impact of surprises like the WIFI breaking or being unavailable.
